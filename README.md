## Project status 
It's worth to add a project status - especially if the project is still being developed. If it's our library, let's mention planned changes, direction of development or to emphasize we're done with its development.

## Sources
This app is inspired by Rando Kim book „Time of Your Life”
and Android app tutorial by [@eericon](https://www.eericon.github.io/post/timer-android)\n
Maybe we use an old tutorial - for example, we write an application with Rails 3 tutorial. From scratch, in accordance with Rails 5 version, using new framework mechanisms. Certainly, it's worth mentioning here.
